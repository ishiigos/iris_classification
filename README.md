# 🌸 Iris Species Classifier Application

This is a simple and interactive Flask web app that predicts the species of an Iris flower — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica* — based on user-provided measurements. The app uses a trained machine learning model built with `scikit-learn` and is deployed on [Render](https://render.com).
