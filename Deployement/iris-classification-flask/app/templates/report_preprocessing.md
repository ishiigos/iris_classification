# Data Preprocessing Report

## Overview
This document outlines the data preprocessing steps taken to prepare the Iris dataset for model training and evaluation. Proper preprocessing is crucial to ensure that the model performs optimally.

## Steps Taken

1. **Loading the Dataset**
   - The Iris dataset was loaded from the CSV file using Pandas.

2. **Data Inspection**
   - Initial inspection of the dataset was performed to understand its structure, including the number of rows and columns, and the data types of each feature.

3. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Checked for any missing values in the dataset. If any were found, appropriate strategies (e.g., imputation or removal) were applied.

4. **Encoding Categorical Variables**
   - Categorical variables (e.g., species) were encoded into numerical format using techniques such as Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

5. **Feature Scaling**
   - Features were scaled using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model training.

6. **Splitting the Dataset**
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Summary
The preprocessing steps outlined above are essential for preparing the data for the Iris classification model. These steps help in improving the model's accuracy and ensuring that it generalizes well to new data. Further details on each step can be found in the respective code implementations.
