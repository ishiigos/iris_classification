# Hyperparameter Tuning Report

## Introduction
This document outlines the hyperparameter tuning process for the Iris classification model. The goal of tuning is to optimize the model's performance by adjusting its hyperparameters.

## Tuning Methodology
- **Model Used**: [Specify the model(s) used, e.g., Random Forest, SVC, etc.]
- **Hyperparameters Tuned**: [List the hyperparameters that were adjusted, e.g., number of trees, max depth, etc.]
- **Tuning Technique**: [Describe the technique used for tuning, e.g., Grid Search, Random Search, etc.]

## Tuning Process
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - The dataset was split into training and validation sets.
   - [Include any preprocessing steps if applicable.]

2. **Hyperparameter Grid**: 
   - [Provide a table or list of the hyperparameter values tested.]

3. **Model Training**: 
   - Each combination of hyperparameters was evaluated using cross-validation.
   - [Include details on the training process, such as the number of folds used.]

## Results
- **Best Hyperparameters**: 
   - [List the best hyperparameter values found during tuning.]
- **Performance Metrics**: 
   - [Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., for the best model.]
   - [Consider including a comparison of performance metrics across different hyperparameter settings.]

## Conclusion
The tuning process successfully identified the optimal hyperparameters for the Iris classification model, resulting in improved performance. Future work may involve further tuning or exploring additional models to enhance accuracy.
