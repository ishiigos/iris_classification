# Model Training Report

## Overview
This document outlines the model training process for the Iris Classification project. It includes details on the dataset used, the model selection process, training results, and any relevant observations.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Iris.csv
- **Description**: The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a target variable (species).

## Model Selection
- **Models Considered**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLP)
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes

- **Selected Model**: [Insert selected model name here]

## Training Process
- **Training/Test Split**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio.
- **Training Parameters**: [Insert training parameters such as epochs, batch size, etc.]

## Results
- **Training Accuracy**: [Insert training accuracy here]
- **Validation Accuracy**: [Insert validation accuracy here]
- **Confusion Matrix**: [Insert confusion matrix here]
